# Notifications

This is my soution to the Notifications Challenge from Frontend Mentor. My solution is responsive for large and smaller screens tho on smaller scrren the app get a bit cramped. I decided to add a bit more for this challenge, mainly to improve my skills. New posts are generated every minute and the times (including the posts are hard coded) are updated accordingly. Both first and last names are randomly picked, then depending on the postType(message, commented, react, followed, joined, left), a post will made to match the layout form the hard coded posts.
